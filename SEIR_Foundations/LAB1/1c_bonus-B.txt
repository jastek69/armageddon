Here, it is assumed that you have your own URL. I'm using chewbacca-growl.com as an example


Alright — Lab 1C-Bonus-B (and yes, we’ll assume the students own chewbacca-growl.com).
This turns your stack into a real enterprise pattern:
  Public ALB (internet-facing)
  Private EC2 targets (no public IP)
  TLS with ACM for chewbacca-growl.com
  WAF attached to ALB
  CloudWatch Dashboard
  SNS alarm on ALB 5xx spikes

This is exactly how modern companies ship: IaC + private compute + managed ingress + TLS + WAF + monitoring + paging. 
If you can submit this in Terraform, you’re no longer “a student who clicked around”— you’re a junior cloud engineers.

Below is a Terraform skeleton overlay you can add to your existing 1C + Bonus-A repo.

Add 1c_bonus_variables.tf (append to variables.tf)

Add file: bonus_b.tf
This assumes you already have from 1C / Bonus-A:
    aws_vpc.chewbacca_vpc01
    aws_subnet.chewbacca_public_subnets
    aws_subnet.chewbacca_private_subnets
    aws_security_group.chewbacca_ec2_sg01 (for private EC2)
    aws_instance.chewbacca_ec201_private_bonus (private EC2 instance)
    aws_sns_topic.chewbacca_sns_topic01 (SNS topic)
